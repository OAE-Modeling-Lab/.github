# OAE Modeling Lab

We are building simulating using [ClimaOcean](https://clima.github.io/ClimaOceanDocumentation/stable/) to simulate ocean alkalinity enhancement interventions. 
Our current goals:
- Building and validating a global ocean model coupled to a biogeochemistry model
- Simulating the anthropogenic addition of alkainity and quantifying the atmospheric carbon removed
- Quantifying uncertainty in carbon removal from the choice of forcing fields
